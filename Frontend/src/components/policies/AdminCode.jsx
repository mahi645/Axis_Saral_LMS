             <p className='text2'><hr/></p>
             <h5 className='heading1'>1. Commitment to integrity</h5>
             <p className='text3'>Your Bank Group’s Code of Conduct is
              the cornerstone of our commitment to integrity. Wherever we operate, we will endeavor to comply with:</p>
            <p className='text3'>– All applicable legal requirements, and
            <br/>–Ethical standards set out in this Code</p>
            <h5 className='heading1'>2.Employees</h5>
            <p className='text3'>At Your Bank we seek to build a workplace that is safe, professional, and supportive of teamwork and trust.
                 Everyone who works for Your Bank contributes to our success and to creating a distinctive company. Working
                  together, drawing
                 from our diverse talents and perspectives, we will stimulate new and creative opportunities for our business.</p>
            <p className='text3'>We are committed to creating a working environment which does not discriminate 
            employees and business associates on the grounds of sex, age, race, religion and culture.We will also seek to work in good faith with trade unions and other bodies
             that our employees collectively choose to represent them within the appropriate legal framework.</p>
            <p className='text3'></p>
            <h5 className='heading1'>3.Business Partners</h5>
            <p className='text3'>At Your Bank, we believe that business relationships founded on trust and mutual
             advantage, where both sides benefit, are vital to our success. We will strive to create mutual advantage 
             by understanding the needs of our customers,
             contractors, suppliers and joint ventures and conducting ourselves honestly, responsibly and fairly.
             Our continued success internationally depends on competing aggressively, but when we compete, 
             we will compete fairly and in full compliance with the law.</p>
            <h5 className='heading2'>3.1. Gifts and entertainment</h5>
            <p className="text4">Your Bank has a strict policy on Gifting and Entertainment; which prescribes
             our employee conduct for all situations. Your Bank follow a strict â€œNo Gifts policy
              for all regulations and statutory bodies and personnel. In all other business situations, the code calls for
             nil gifting and prescribes nominal values for certain trade and local custom related gifting occasions.</p>
             <p className="text4">The exchange of gifts and entertainment can build goodwill in business relationship,
              but some gifts and entertainment can create improper influence.
              Some even can be seen as bribes that tarnish WIPRO UNZA’s reputation for fair dealing or break the law.</p>
            <h5 className="heading2">3.2. Conflicts of interest</h5>
            <p className="text4">Your Bank respects its employee’s privacy and therefore does not normally take an 
            interest in personal conduct outside of work. However, when an employee’s personal, social, financial or 
            political activities have potential of interfering with the employee’s loyalty and objectivity toward the Group, 
            a conflict of interest may exist that must be satisfactorily resolved. Actual conflicts must 
            be avoided, but even the appearance of a conflict of interest can be harmful, too.</p>
            <p className="text4">Conflicts of interest can arise in many ways. Here are examples of some of the common ones.
             Outside employment and affiliation can create conflicts of interest:</p>
             <p className="text4">– A second job<br/>
                – Serving as a director or consultant<br/>
                – Holding a financial interest (either directly or via a spouse or close relative)</p>
              <p className="text4">Any of the above relating to an organization that is a competitor,
               customer or supplier of goods and services to Your Bank, 
              may raise a conflict of interest, or the appearance of a conflict of interest.</p>
              <h5 className="heading2">3.3. Money laundering</h5>
              <p className="text4">Money Laundering is the process by which individuals or entities try to conceal
               illicit funds, or otherwise make these funds look legitimate.<br/>
                Your Bank will not condone, facilitate, or support money laundering.</p>
                <h5 className="heading1">4. Company assets & financial integrity</h5>
                <p className="text3">We have the responsibility as well as a legal duty to protect the physical, 
                intellectual property and financial assets of Your Bank. We will comply with all applicable laws 
                and regulations (including GAAP) in each jurisdiction where we operate. We will be forthright & 
                transparent about our operations and performance, accurate in the recording and 
                reporting of data and results and exercise care in the use of our assets and resources.</p>
                <p className="text3">Documents and records must be retained in accordance with the law.</p>
                <h5 className="heading1">5. Governments, business associates and communities</h5>
                <p className="text3">Your Bank's aim is that in the countries and communities in which we operate
                 should benefit from our presence, through the wealth and jobs created, the skills developed within
                  the local population and the investment of our time and money in people. We will work towards 
                improvements that are measurable and contribute to the real, independent growth of communities where
                 we operate.</p>
                <p className="text3">We will not engage in bribery or corruption in any form.
                 Corruption is the enemy of development and human progress, and we are committed to transparency 
                 in all our dealings.</p>
                <p className="text3">We will engage constructively with all governments in whose jurisdiction we operate. 
                The company will not participate in political activity, and will make no political contributions in any country.</p>
                <h5 className="heading1">6. External communication – investors, analysts & the media</h5>
                <p className="text3">External communications with these audiences require careful consideration and require 
                a unique understanding of legal and media issues. Only those employees specially authorized to do so may respond to
                 enquiries from members of the investment community (e.g. shareholders, brokers, investment analysts, media etc.).</p>
                <h5 className="heading1">7. Health, safety, security and the environment (HSSE)</h5>
                <p className="text3">Your Bank is committed to providing every Your Bank employee, and those of other companies 
                working on our premises, with a safe and secure work environment where no one is subject to unnecessary risk.</p>
                <p className="text3">We recognize that safe operations depend not only on sound plant and equipment, but also on
                 competent people and an active HSSE culture.</p>
                <p className="text3">Simply obeying safety rules is not enough. Your Bank’s commitment to safety means each of
                 us needs to be alert to safety risks as we go about our jobs.</p>
                <p className="text3">Simply obeying safety rules is not enough. Your Bank’s commitment to safety means each of
